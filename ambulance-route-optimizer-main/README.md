ðŸš‘ Ambulance Route Optimization Web App This project is a full-stack web application that helps optimize ambulance routes by identifying the nearest hospital using Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm based on userâ€™s real-time geolocation. It integrates mapping APIs, hospital data, and graph-based pathfinding to assist in emergency decision-making.

**Features**


Real-time user location detection using browser geolocation

Dynamic hospital mapping from a JSON dataset using Leaflet and OpenStreetMap

Distance calculation between coordinates using the Haversine formula

Optimized shortest path finding using Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm

Visual route suggestion and hospital name display on map

Backend powered by Flask for data processing and API endpoints

**Backend Logic**



Hospital Data Load: Reads a JSON file containing hospital names and coordinates.

Distance Calculation: Uses the Haversine formula to compute real-world distances between hospitals and the user.

Graph Creation: Builds a graph with hospitals as nodes and distances as edge weights.

Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm: Finds the shortest path from the user's location to the nearest hospital.

API Endpoint: Responds to frontend with the nearest hospital based on calculated path.

**Frontend**



Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Leaflet.js

Fetches geolocation and sends it to the Flask backend

Visualizes hospitals and nearest path suggestion on an interactive map

**Tech Stack**



Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Leaflet.js, OpenStreetMap

Backend: Python, Flask

Algorithms: Haversine Formula, Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm

Deployment: Localhost (easily deployable on cloud platforms)

**Future Improvements**



Real-time traffic data integration

Live hospital availability and bed status (via API)

Ambulance booking and tracking functionality

User authentication and emergency contact sharing
